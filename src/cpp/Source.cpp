/**
 * Return an approximate apparent location on sky for a major planet, Sun, Moon, Earth-Moon
 * Barycenter (EMB) -- typically to arcmin level accuracy -- using Keplerian orbital elements. The
 * returned position is antedated for light-travel time (for Solar-System bodies). It also applies
 * an appropriate aberration correction (but not gravitational deflection).
 *
 * The orbitals can provide planet positions to arcmin-level precision for the rocky inner
 * planets, and to a fraction of a degree precision for the gas and ice giants and Pluto. The
 * accuracies for Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are significantly improved (to the arcmin level) if
 * used in the time range of 1800 AD to 2050 AD. For a more detailed summary of the typical
 * accuracies, see either of the top two references below.
 *
 * For accurate positions, you should use planetary ephemerides (such as the JPL ephemerides via
 * the CALCEPH or CSPICE plugins) and `novas_sky_pos()` instead.
 *
 * While this function is generally similar to creating an orbital object with an orbit
 * initialized with `novas_make_planet_orbit()` or `novas_make_moon_orbit()`, and then calling
 * `novas_sky_pos()`, there are a few important differences to note:
 *
 *  1. This function calculates Earth and Moon positions about the Keplerian orbital position
 *     of the Earth-Moon Barycenter (EMB). In contrast, `novas_make_planet_orbit()` does not
 *     provide orbitals for the Earth directly, and `make_moot_orbit()` references the Moon's
 *     orbital to the Earth position returned by the currently configured planet calculator
 *     function (see `set_planet_provider()`).
 *
 *  2. This function ignores gravitational deflection. It makes little sense to bother about
 *     corrections that are orders of magnitude below the accuracy of the orbital positions
 *     obtained.
